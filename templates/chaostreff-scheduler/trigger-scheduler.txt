Dummy text file to trigger the 'schedule' GitHub action
which runs the chaostreff-scheduler to schedule our events.

We have this because we can't trigger a GitHub action in the UI.
Only for already runned actions :(


The 'schedule' GitHub actions runs
  - on the 1st of every month
  - changes in 'templates/chaostreff-scheduler/**'

To trigger the action, edit any file in this directory.

You can increment this counter: 20
and commit / push your changes to trigger the action.
